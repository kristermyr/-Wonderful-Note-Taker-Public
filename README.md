  ## Description
The Wonderful note taker shows some of my newly learned skills working with express, and node. I have learned an introduction in how you can make CRUD requests. I have learned a lot about how to receive and send information and how to handle it. When deleting the notes, the response take some time to get back, but it does delete the notes.
